# GLOBAL-SOLUTIONS- Employee Management project
This project includes a development presentation of an information system for managing the staff data within a small company or organization. 
The process of constructing this system involves a mutual development of application program and database. The application program is actually the bridge between the users
and the database, where the data is stored. This system should consist of an application program, on one hand, and a database (repository of data) on the other. 
Thus, the well-developed application program and database are very important for the reliability, flexibility and functionality of the system.

Front end – HTML, CSS. 
 Backend – PHP.
 Database – MySQL.
 Browser – Google Chrome.
 Code Editor – Visual Studio Code.
